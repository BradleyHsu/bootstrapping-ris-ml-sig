# Projects

## MNIST RIS

The directory "mnist_ris" contains resources to train a Pytorch Ligtning model with MNIST dataset in the RIS Compute Environment using a single GPU.

Inside the directory there is a script file "ris_mnist.py" and a README file that has detailed instructions on how to run the script.
