2. Add your code to the branch
3. Issue a pull request to the `main` branch, tagging someone else that will run the code to verify it will work.
4. Tag @jacobsn to merge to `main`

# Projects

## MNIST RIS

The directory `mnist_ris` contains resources to train a Pytorch Ligtning model with MNIST dataset in the RIS Compute Environment using a single GPU.

Inside the directory there is a script file `ris_mnist.py` and a README file that has detailed instructions on how to run the script.

## MNIST standalone(albatross)

The directory `mnist_standalone` contains resources to train a Pytorch Ligtning model with MNIST dataset in the lab's GPU.

Inside the directory there is a script file `mnist.py` and a `README.md` file that has detailed instructions on how to install miniconda, create and activate conda environment, and the script `mnist.py`
